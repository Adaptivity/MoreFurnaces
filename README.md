The Mo' Furnaces mod is a mod that (as the name says) adds more furnaces. Each furnace has a variety of features. Some furnaces are very easy to make, but very slow (still faster than regular furnace though). Others can't smelt ores. The possibilities are endless!

This mod is for Minecraft 1.7.2 paired with the Recommended Forge Build!
